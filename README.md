# National Parks Trip Planner
https://alexanderquach.github.io/National-Parks-Planner-API-Capstone/

Motivation: As a nature-lover, national parks and monuments are always on my list of places I want to visit.
I wanted to create an app more dedicated to helping out with planning trips by allowing users to find national 
parks by state, display them on a map, and give more information with the click of a button, including 
restaurants in the vicinity.

Languages/technologies used: HTML / CSS / JavaScript / jQuery / Bootstrap

APIs used: National Park Service / Google Maps / Zomato
